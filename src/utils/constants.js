2.1 This agreement ("Agreement") forms a legally binding contract between You and DML in relation to Your use of DML Infrastructure to distribute Products. You are contracting with the applicable DML entity based on where You have selected to distribute Your Product (as set forth here). You acknowledge that DML will, solely at Your direction, display and make Your Products available for viewing, download, and purchase by users. In order to use DML Infrastructure to distribute Products, You accept this Agreement and will provide and maintain complete and accurate information in the DML Marketplace.

2.2 DML will not permit the distribution of Your Products through DML Infrastructure, and You may not accept the Agreement, unless You are verified as a Developer in good standing.

2.3 If You are agreeing to be bound by this Agreement on behalf of Your employer or other entity, You represent and warrant that You have full legal authority to bind Your employer or such entity to this Agreement. If You do not have the requisite authority, You may not accept the Agreement or use DML Infrastructure on behalf of Your employer or other entity.

3. Use of DML Infrastructure by You

3.1 You are responsible for uploading Your Products to DML Infrastructure, providing required Product information and support to users, and accurately disclosing the permissions necessary for the Product to function on user Devices.

3.2 You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of any developer credentials that DML may issue to You or which You may choose Yourself and You are solely responsible for all Products that are developed under Your developer credentials. DML may limit the number of Developer Accounts issued to You or to the company or organization You work for.

3.3 Except for the license rights granted by You in this Agreement, DML agrees that it obtains no right, title, or interest from You (or Your licensors) under this Agreement in or to any of Your Products, including any Intellectual Property Rights in those Products.

3.4 You may not use DML Infrastructure to distribute or make available any Product which has a purpose that facilitates the distribution of software applications and algorithm for use on mobile devices outside of DML Infrastructure.

3.5 You agree to use DML Infrastructure only for purposes that are permitted by this Agreement and any applicable law, regulation, or generally accepted practices or guidelines in the relevant jurisdictions (including any laws regarding the export of data or software to and from the Singapore or other relevant countries).

3.6 Users are instructed to contact You concerning any defects or performance issues in Your Products. As between You and DML, You will be solely responsible, and DML will have no responsibility, to undertake or handle support and maintenance of Your Products and any complaints about Your Products. You agree to supply and maintain valid and accurate contact information that will be displayed in each of Your Productsâ€™ detail page and made available to users for customer support and legal purposes. For Your paid Products, You agree to respond to customer support inquiries within 3 business days, and within 24 hours to any support or Product concerns stated to be urgent by DML. Failure to provide adequate information or support for Your Products may result in less prominent Product exposure or removal from DML Infrastructure by DML and may result in low Product ratings, lower sales, and billing disputes by users.

3.7 You agree that if You make Your Products available through DML Infrastructure, You will protect the privacy and legal rights of users. If the users provide You with, or Your Product accesses or uses, usernames, passwords, or other login information or personal information, You agree to make the users aware that the information will be available to Your Product, and You agree to provide legally adequate privacy notice and protection for those users. Further, Your Product may only use that information for the limited purposes for which the user has given You permission to do so. If Your Product stores personal or sensitive information provided by users, You agree to do so securely and only for as long as it is needed. However, if the user has opted into a separate agreement with You that allows You or Your Product to store or use personal or sensitive information directly related to Your Product (not including other products or applications), then the terms of that separate agreement will govern Your use of such information. If the user provides Your Product with DML Account information, Your Product may only use that information to access the user's DML Account when, and for the limited purposes for which, the user has given You permission to do so.

3.8 You will not engage in any activity with DML Infrastructure, including making Your Products available via DML Infrastructure, that interferes with, disrupts, damages, or accesses in an unauthorized manner the devices, servers, networks, or other properties or services of any third party including, but not limited to, DML or any Authorized Provider. You may not use user information obtained via DML Infrastructure to sell or distribute Products outside of DML Infrastructure.

3.9 You are solely responsible for, and DML has no responsibility to You for, Your Products, including use of any DML Infrastructure APIs and for the consequences of Your actions, including any loss or damage which DML may suffer.

3.10 DML Infrastructure allows users to rate and review Products. Only users who download the applicable Product will be able to rate and review it on DML Infrastructure. Product ratings may be used to determine the placement of Products on DML Infrastructure. DML Infrastructure may also assign You a composite score for any of Your Products that has not received user ratings. A composite score will be a representation of the quality of Your Product based on Your history and will be determined at DML's sole discretion. For new Developers without Product history, DML may use or publish performance measurements such as uninstall and/or refund rates to identify or remove Products that are not meeting acceptable standards, as determined by DML. DML reserves the right to display Products to users in a manner that will be determined at DML's sole discretion. Your Products may be subject to user ratings to which You may not agree. You may contact DML if You have any questions or concerns regarding such ratings.

Users in a family group may purchase a single copy of the Product (unless otherwise prohibited, as for in-app and subscription Products) and share it with other family members in their family group. If, in the DML Marketplace, You opt in to allowing users to share previously purchased Products, Your authorization of sharing of those purchases by those users is subject to this Agreement. If You choose, You may include a separate end user license agreement (EULA) in Your Product that will govern the userâ€™s rights to the Product, but, to the extent that EULA conflicts with this Agreement, this Agreement will supersede the EULA.

5. Brand Features and Publicity

5.1 Each party will own all right, title, and interest, including, without limitation, all Intellectual Property Rights, relating to its Brand Features. Except to the limited extent expressly provided in this Agreement, neither party grants, nor will the other party acquire, any right, title, or interest (including, without limitation, any implied license) in or to any Brand Features of the other party.

5.2 Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, Developer grants to DML and its affiliates a limited, nonexclusive, royalty-free license during the term of this Agreement to display Developer Brand Features, submitted by Developer to DML, for use solely online or on mobile devices and in either case solely in connection with the distribution and sale of Developer's Product via DML Infrastructure or to otherwise fulfill its obligations under this Agreement.

5.3 In addition to the license granted in Section 5.2 above, for purposes of marketing the presence, distribution, and sale of Your Product via DML Infrastructure and its availability for use on devices and through other DML services, DML and its affiliates may include visual elements from Your Product (including characters and videos of game play) and Developer Brand Features (a) within DML Infrastructure and in any DML-owned online or mobile properties; (b) in online, mobile, television, out of home (e.g. billboard), and print advertising formats outside DML Infrastructure; (c) when making announcements of the availability of the Product; (d) in presentations; and (e) in customer lists which appear either online or on mobile devices (which includes, without limitation, customer lists posted on DML websites).

6.1 DML may run promotional activities offering coupons, credits, and/or other promotional incentives for paid transactions and/or user actions for Your Products and in-app transactions solely in connection with DML Infrastructure promotions and, for gift card promotions, also on DML authorized third-party channels ("Promotion(s)"), provided that (a) amounts payable to You will not be impacted; (b) there will be clear communication to users that the Promotion is from DML and not You; (c) the prices You establish will be clearly communicated to users; (d) any redemption of the Promotion will be fulfilled by DML or, for gift card Promotions, through a DML authorized third party; and (e) DML will be responsible for compliance with applicable law for the Promotion.

7. Product Takedowns

7.1 You may remove Your Products from future distribution via DML Infrastructure at any time, but You agree to comply with this Agreement and the Payment Processor's Payment Account terms of service for any Products distributed via DML Infrastructure prior to removal including, but not limited to, refund requirements. Removing Your Products from future distribution via DML Infrastructure does not (a) affect the license rights of users who have previously purchased or downloaded Your Products; (b) remove Your Products from Devices or from any part of DML Infrastructure where previously purchased or downloaded applications are stored on behalf of users; or (c) change Your obligation to deliver or support Products or services that have been previously purchased or downloaded by users.

7.2 Notwithstanding Section 7.1, in no event will DML maintain on any portion of DML Infrastructure (including, without limitation, the part of DML Infrastructure where previously purchased or downloaded applications are stored on behalf of users) any Product that You have removed from DML Infrastructure and provided written notice to DML that such removal was due to (a) an allegation of infringement, or actual infringement, of any third party Intellectual Property Right; (b) an allegation of, or actual violation of, third party rights; or (c) an allegation or determination that such Product does not comply with applicable law (collectively "Legal Takedowns"). If a Product is removed from DML Infrastructure due to a Legal Takedown and an end user purchased such Product within a year before the date of takedown, at DML's request, You agree to refund to the end user all amounts paid by such end user for such Product.

7.3 DML does not undertake an obligation to monitor the Products or their content. If DML becomes aware and determines in its sole discretion that a Product or any portion thereof (a) violates any applicable law; (b) violates this Agreement, applicable policies, or other terms of service, as may be updated by DML from time to time in its sole discretion; (c) violates terms of distribution agreement with device manufacturers and Authorized Providers; or (d) creates liability for or has an adverse impact on DML or Authorized Providers; then DML may reject, remove, suspend, or reclassify the Product from DML Infrastructure or from Devices. DML reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to suspend and/or bar any Product and/or Developer from DML Infrastructure or from Devices. If Your Product contains elements that could cause serious harm to user devices or data, DML may at its discretion disable the Product or remove it from Devices on which it has been installed. If Your Product is rejected, removed, or suspended from DML Infrastructure or from Devices pursuant to this Section 7.3, then DML may withhold payments due to Developer.

7.4 DML enters into distribution agreements with device manufacturers and Authorized Providers to place the DML Infrastructure software client application(s) on Devices. These distribution agreements may require the involuntary removal of Products in violation of the Device manufacturer's or Authorized Provider's terms of service.
